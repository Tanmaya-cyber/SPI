# SPI


## Introduction 


## Objectives
1.  To implement the logic using Verilog and therefore, establish the SPI communication between 2 FPGA boards.
2. To do waveform analysis and verify the feasibility of the state machine that we have designed.
3. To verify the full-duplex communication i.e. correct data is transmitted and received.
