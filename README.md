# SPI


## Introduction 
SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a high-speed, synchronous serial communication protocol used for short-distance communication between microcontrollers and peripheral devices such as sensors, displays, memory modules, and more. It operates in a master-slave architecture, where a single master controls multiple slave devices.

### SPI Pins
_SPI typically uses four main signal lines_:

MOSI (Master Out, Slave In) – Data sent from the master to the slave.
MISO (Master In, Slave Out) – Data sent from the slave to the master.
SCK (Serial Clock) – Clock signal generated by the master to synchronize communication.
CS/SS (Chip Select/Slave Select) – Active-low signal to select a specific slave device.

### SPI Modes

The table below shows the four SPI modes based on Clock Polarity (CPOL) and Clock Phase (CPHA):

| Mode | CPOL | CPHA | Clock Idle State | Data Sampling |
|------|------|------|-----------------|--------------|
| 0    | 0    | 0    | Low             | Leading Edge (Rising) |
| 1    | 0    | 1    | Low             | Trailing Edge (Falling) |
| 2    | 1    | 0    | High            | Leading Edge (Falling) |
| 3    | 1    | 1    | High            | Trailing Edge (Rising) |


## Objectives
1.  To implement the logic using Verilog and therefore, establish the SPI communication between 2 FPGA boards.
2. To do waveform analysis and verify the feasibility of the state machine that we have designed.
3. To verify the full-duplex communication i.e. correct data is transmitted and received.
